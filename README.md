### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

A Full-Stack Software Engineer with a wealth of experience from my previous career in the service industry as well as an ever-expanding set of tools to help accomplish whatever tasks come my way.

While versed in HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, Node, and PostgreSQL, I'm continually expanding my knowledge base. Lately, I've been spending my time exploring Python, React-Native, and cloud-based services such as AWS Amplify and Google Firebase.

From my service industry experience, I've learned to work with a variety of team sizes, coworkers with varying personalities and backgrounds, and thrive in a customer-facing environment.
